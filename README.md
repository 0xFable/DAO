## Executive Summary

- InterWasm DAO is organisation that will ensure the success of CosmWasm Ecosystem
	- Own codebases
	- Fund community good projects
	- Boost community growth
	- Organize events
- Later it will become an on-chain DAO
- Initial fund $200K USD in ATOMs collected under multisig wallet
- Fund distribution will be approved by multisig wallet owners

## What Is InterWasm DAO

CosmWasm was born at Hackatom Berlin 2019 by the hands of several code magicians. Initially it was just testing a possibility.

Now CosmWasm spans many blockchains, communities, and continents. As today, the technology powers and secures trillions of dollars. Many more eyes looking into CosmWasm, either as smart contract devs, or blockchains that desires Cosmos and CosmWasm capabilities.

CosmWasm is first citizen cross chain platform, and a value owned and accrued cross chain. 

Nature of CosmWasm is a perfect fit to prove again decentralized organisation and funding is efficient than old rules.

**InterWasm DAO** is the organisation behind CosmWasm and cw tooling.

It is run by initially chain foundations, then owned by an open community.

## Definition of DAO's roles

InterWasm DAO will own:

-   CosmWasm codebase ownership will be delegated to the community gradually
    -   Initially CosmWasm docs repo maintainership will be owned by foundations.
    -   Community contracts will be collected under cosmwasm-contracts repo.
    -   High quality smart contracts should be collected under cosmwasm-plus. Quality of the code ensured by repo maintainers.
-   Fund distribution among the community goods projects.
-   Organising cross chain events.
-   Developer Relations data collection(developer number, community size etc...) and sharing with community.

## Fund

InterWasm DAO should distribute funds effectively among community good projects.

Initially, we will collect ATOMs worth $200K. And start funding projects right away.

## Decision Making

Initially decision making will happen by communication in open/closed between foundation chats.

Each foundation will provide and address which will be used for forming %66 percent approval multisig wallet.

Agreeing foundations will sign send the required funds to project funding addresses.

InterWasm DAO must decentralize more to open up to the community. This will be done making the organisation a real on chain DAO smart contract.

As Confio, we propose hosting InterWasm DAO on a neutral zone: **Juno network**.

Juno Network ensures gaia hub IBC bridge right from the launch.

Details and implementation of the smart contract will be discussed later.

## Fund Initial Board
These are the project involved mostly in CosmWasm community.
More members can be added later.

- Confio
- Terraform Labs
- Enigma
- Juno community representatives

## Proposals

Proposals are structured and organised way for decentralized decision making.

Projects can ask for funds using proposals,

Changes to common CosmWasm code should be done through proposals.

Initially proposals will be collected under CosmWasm github organisation under InterWasm repo.

I think **IWP**(InterWasm Proposal) is a good prefix.

## Workgroups

For the internal and external projects, InterWasm DAO members can form workgroups and work in specific manner.


## First 6 months

Here are few projects to fund:
- **Code and Smart Contract Explorer**
- **CosmWasm AssemblyScript Integration**
- **Documentation and Tutorial funding**
- **1.0-rc1 Audit**
- **CosmWasm IDE by OraiChain**

Misc:
- **Maintain InterWasm Events Calendar**
